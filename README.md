# üè° Real Estate Price Prediction

This project walks through the complete process of analyzing and predicting house prices using machine learning. It covers collecting data, importing it into a Jupyter Notebook, exploring features, handling missing values, building pipelines, and training a predictive model. The final model can be used by real estate companies to estimate housing prices based on key attributes.

## üìñ Introduction
In this project, we will analyze housing prices in Boston suburbs. We will:
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Explore key features and relationships.
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Build a machine learning model to predict housing prices.
- Implement techniques such as cross-validation, stratified sampling, and train-test splitting.

## üìä Dataset
**Title:** Boston Housing Data  
**Sources:**
- Origin: StatLib Library, Carnegie Mellon University
- Creators: Harrison, D. & Rubinfeld, D.L.
- First published in *J. Environ. Economics & Management* (1978)

**Number of Instances:** 506  
**Number of Attributes:** 14 (13 features + 1 target variable)

### **Attribute Information:**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| CRIM | Per capita crime rate by town |
| ZN | Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. |
| INDUS | Proportion of non-retail business acres per town |
| CHAS | Charles River dummy variable (1 if bounds river; 0 otherwise) |
| NOX | Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million) |
| RM | Average number of rooms per dwelling |
| AGE | Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940 |
| DIS | Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers |
| RAD | Index of accessibility to radial highways |
| TAX | Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000 |
| PTRATIO | Pupil-teacher ratio by town |
| B | 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black residents |
| LSTAT | % lower status of the population |
| MEDV | Median value of owner-occupied homes (target variable) |

**Missing Values:** None

## ü§ñ Model Training
We follow these steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize/standardize numerical features
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Split data into training & test sets
2. **Feature Selection & Engineering**
3. **Model Selection & Training:**
   - Train various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests)
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R¬≤ Score
